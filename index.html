              that he could not fully explain. From the outside, it was a wonder that he was able
              to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely no plans to be productive during the entire day.</p>

               He was late and if he didn't make this meeting on time, someone's life may be in danger.</p>

              This wasn't an easy task as the children had other priorities than to get to the gate. She knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled at the kids to keep up. They continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed them down. They had no idea the wrath they were
              about to receive when Catherine made it to the gate only to be informed that they had all missed the plane.</p>

              They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue.
              One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her
              was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion.

              and chuckled under his breath. Of course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be able to answer?
              He put the phone down and continued on his project. He was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so.</p>
